This is an interactive, online SOX streetlight simulator program, written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The streetlight shown is a Philips MI26. 
The "Switch on time" selector allows the user to select a time for the streetlight to turn on at. 
The "Warm up time" feature allows the user to specify how long the streetlight should take to warm up.
The "Sensitivity" feature simulates the photocell, and the higher the sensitivity, the more random the turn on time can be e.g. if the user selects 5, and a "Switch on time" of 20:00, the streetlight will turn on at a random time between 19:55 and 20:05.
